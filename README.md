This repository contains the code developed for syngas yield prediction using deep learning models. Three different syngas components (CO, H₂, and CH₄) were predicted using the following architectures:

-Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

-Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

-Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

-Hybrid CNN–LSTM

The repository includes three separate prediction scripts:

CO_Prediction.py – Prediction of Carbon Monoxide (CO) yield

H2_Prediction.py – Prediction of Hydrogen (H₂) yield

CH4_Prediction.py – Prediction of Methane (CH₄) yield
